# FS22_aPalletAutoLoader_Extension_HofBergmann

This is an example extension for my Pallet Autoloader mod.
An Extension adds new goods to be loadable when a modder or mapper has created pallet sizes which are not fitting the basegame ones.
Such extensions can be stand allown mods like this one or integrated in a mod where the pallets are in.
So only when a user has this mod, the additional loading size will be shown an when not he do not need to click over them all the time.

First Version were created by my, then it was reworked by Maverick1305 after an Hof Bergmann update.
